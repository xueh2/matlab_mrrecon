% SimpleViewer  A simple keyboard controlled movie viewer
% 
% ----- Syntax -----------------------------------------------------------------
%  SimpleViewer(img [, CLim, roi, txt, tileSize, prefs])
%  SimpleViewer(fileName)
%
%  img      - can be either:
%             - a 5d matrix: img(:,:,slice,time,subplot)
%             - a 1d cell array: img{time}
%             - a 3d nested cell array: img{subplot}{slice}{time}
%  CLim     - colormap limits (analogous to CLim in imagesc)
%  txt      - image titles (format: txt{subplot}{slice}{time})
%             It is permissible to have only one title for all times within a
%             given slice and subplot.
%  roi      - roi vertices (format: roi{subplot}{slice}{time}{roi})
%             Each ROI is defined by vertices in a N-by-2 arrays
%             [X1 Y1;...;XN YN].
%  tileSize - tiling size for subplots (format: [nRows nCols])
%  XLim     - x-axis limits, either as a 1x2 array or a cell array of 1x2 arrays
%             specifying XLims for each subplot
%  YLim     - y-axis limits with the same format as XLim
%  cmap     - colormap, either a single Nx3 array or a cell array of Nx3 arrays
%             specifying colormaps for each subplot
%  prefs    - struct with entries that override default preferences
%
%  All arguments aside from img are optional and may be set as an empty matrix
%  in order to set arguments further down the list.  prefs may also be passed as
%  the last argument, even if it is not in the 6th position.  SimpleViewer may
%  be called with no arguments to display the calling syntax and a list of
%  preferences.
%
%  SimpleViewer may be called by passing the file name of a DICOM, NIfTI, any
%  image format supported by imread (e.g. bmp, jpg, gif, ...), or any video
%  format supported by VideoReader (e.g. avi, mpg, ...).  Wildcards can be used
%  to load multiple images/NIfTI files.
%
%  SimpleViewer may also be passed a SimpleViewer workspace (.svmat or .mat)
%  file created by using 'shift + s' within a previous SimpleViewer instance.
%
% ----- Overview ---------------------------------------------------------------
%  The most basic functionality of SimpleViewer is provide easy visualization of
%  an image series, often one or more sets of time series.  If these time series
%  are of consistent enough dimensions that they can be represented as an <= 5
%  dimensional matrix, SimpleViewer can simply be called by passing this matrix
%  in the format of (:,:,slice,time,subplot), where the first two dimensions are
%  y and x respectively (i.e. standard row/column).  If a 3D matrix is passed,
%  the third dimension is assumed to be time, unless the autoSlicesToCine pref
%  option is set to false.  The left/right arrow keys and mouse scroll may be
%  used to advance/reverse in time, and the up/down arrow keys are used to
%  change slice.  The time/slice changes are applied to all subplots.  The
%  spacebar may be used to return to a ("home") frame (default: 1).  'ctrl +
%  space' may be used to start/stop playing the data in a loop in the time
%  dimension.
%
%  The displayed contrast of the images may adjusted using the window/level tool
%  ('w'), and the zoom of the images can be adjusted using the pan/zoom tool
%  ('z'), as detailed below.  The colormap can be cycled using 'm' and a
%  colorbar displayed using 'b'.  The overall window size can be adjusted by
%  resizing the window or by using the +/- keys.
%
%  The second major feature of SimpleViewer is the tools to draw and manipulate
%  regions of interest (ROIs).  Arbitrary polygons can be drawn and then
%  manipulated by moving their center or vertices or scaling them
%  larger/smaller.  A nudge tool can also be used to move vertices with a
%  circular brush.  ROI editing can be done on subplots independently or linked
%  between subplots or copy/pasted between subplots or SimpleViewer windows.
%
%  The third aspect of SimpleViewer is to provide some basic analysis of image
%  data.  Information about an ROI such as its circumference, area, as well as
%  the mean and standard deviation of pixels contained within it can be toggled
%  using the 'i' key.  The 'g' key can be used to open up a secondary window
%  with further information and contains tables of the mean and standard
%  deviation and a plot of the mean +/- standard deviation signal intensity as a
%  function of time.  If a line ROI is drawn, the profile across that line is
%  shown across time (similar to an echocardiography 'm-mode').
%
%  Finally, SimpleViewer data may be exported as images (e.g. .jpg, .png, .gif,
%  etc), animated GIFs, or movies (.avi or .mp4).  A SimpleViewer "workspace",
%  containing the image data, ROIs, window/level settings, etc. can be also be
%  saved in a .svmat format (which is a standard .mat file), and these
%  workspaces can reloaded by passing the filename to SimpleViewer.

%
% ----- Detailed Usage ---------------------------------------------------------
% Nested Cell Arrays
%  Image data can be supplied as a <=5 dimensional array if the size of images
%  is consistent over time, number of times is consistent across slices, and
%  number of slices is consistent across subplots.  However, there may be
%  instances in which this criteria is not satisfied, e.g. displaying images of
%  different sizes or displaying a time series of images along with a parametric
%  map.  In these cases, images must be supplied as a nested cell array, in
%  img{subplot}{slice}{time} format.  This allows flexibility in both image
%  size, time, and slice dimensions at the expense of increased complexity in
%  data formatting.  This format is required for ROIs and text inputs, as a
%  simple 5-dimensional array is not flexible enough to hold this data.  A
%  non-nested three-dimensional cell array may be considered in the future but
%  is currently not supported.
%
% Global Preferences
%  Preferences can also be set using the global variable "svPrefs", which takes
%  precendence over the defaultPrefs defined in this file, but are overridden by
%  the prefs argument when calling SimpleViewer.
%
% ROI Drawing
%  ROIs can be created while in the "draw" mode (toggled with 'd').  To draw a
%  single point ROI, simply right-click. To start a multi-point ROI, left-click
%  to draw the first vertex, and continue left-clicking to add additional
%  vertices.  The delete/backspace key can be used to delete the last vertex.
%  The ROI is completed with a right-click, which draws the last vertex and
%  finishes the ROI.  The ROI may also be completed with a shift right-click,
%  which draws the last vertex, but finishes the ROI as line segment.  Line
%  segments produce a spatial profile along the segment in the plot window (if
%  enabled).  They are represented internally as a list of vertices terminated
%  with NaNs.
%
% ROI Selection and Adjustment
%  Click on any part (center, vertices, edges) of an ROI to select it. The
%  currently selected ROI is indicated with dashed edge lines instead of solid
%  lines. The ROI may be moved by left-click dragging the center, and individual
%  vertices may also be moved in the same way. Shift left-click on a vertex to
%  delete it and shift left-click an edge to add a vertex.
%
% ROI Clipboard
%  The 'c' and 'v' keys can be used to copy and paste one or more ROIs to and
%  from a clipboard.  The clipboard is shared within a figure, and can be used
%  between subplots and frames (time or slice).  If the 'shift' modifier is used
%  with the 'c' and 'v' keys, ROIs are copied to/from a global clipboard shared
%  with all figures.
%
% Static ROI mode
%  When Static ROI is enabled, ROIs drawn are copied across all time frames
%  within the current slice.  In this mode, the time frame may also be changed
%  while drawing an ROI.  With Static ROI mode off, ROIs in each time frame are
%  individually adjusted.  A warning is displayed with Static ROI mode off
%  unless prefs.showStaticRoiStatus is set to false.
%
% Nudge Tool
%  Enter/exit the nudge tool by pressing 'n'.  In nudge mode, left click-hold
%  creates a circular "force field" around the mouse cursor.  With the button
%  held down, move the mouse around and any ROI vertex that touches the force
%  field is pushed away from the mouse cursor.  Right click-hold creates an
%  "inverse force field" that contains ROI vertices within its borders.  If an
%  ROI is selected, only that ROI is affected.  Otherwise, all ROIs are
%  affected.  The radius of the force fields is determined by the distance to
%  the nearest vertex when mouse button is depressed -- start with the mouse
%  cursor farther away from vertices to create a field with a larger radius.
%  The last change to an ROI with the nudge tool can be undone with the 'u' key,
%  where the "last change" is defined as the last left-click (drag), whether any
%  vertices were moved or not.
%
% Circle Tool
%  Enter/exit the circle tool by pressing 'o'.  A blue and red circle outline is
%  shown and follows the cursor.  The  '[' and ']' keys can be used to shrink 
%  and grow the circle respectively.  Left-click to place the ROI.  The default
%  radius and number points in the circle is controlled in the preferences via
%  'circleRadius' and 'circlePoints' respectively.
%
% Automatic Circle Tool
%  Circles can be automatically detected using the Hough transform via the
%  imfindcircles function in the Image Processing Toolbox. To use this within
%  SimpleViewer, window/level the image to generate good contrast between the
%  circles and its surroundings, then press shift+'o'.  Detected circles are
%  shown with a red outline.  Click on each circle in the order it should be
%  added and press enter when done.  If none of the detected circles are
%  appropriate, press enter to finish (and not esc).
%
% Interpolate ROI
%  Interpolate the selected ROI to have pref.interpNPts vertices, where the last
%  prefs.interpIgnoreLast edges of the ROI are ignored in the interpolation.  If
%  no ROIs are selected, all ROIs on the current frame are interpolated.  If
%  prefs.autoInterpolateRois is set to true, ROIs are automatically interpolated
%  as soon as it is finished being drawn and after nudging.
%
% Interpolate ROI (new)
%  - 'display' - Use prefs.interpAlgorithm to interpolate the displayed line
%                between ROI vertices
%  - 'finish'  - Upon finishing a new ROI, use prefs.interpAlgorithm to
%                interpolate it to pref.interpNPts points.  The ROI is not
%                further interpolated and lines are linear between vertices
%  - 'always'  - ROIs are interpolated when finished (i.e. 'finish' mode), and
%                also after each nudge. Note: This is the same as setting
%                prefs.autoInterpolateRois to true
%  - 'none'    - Do not automatically interpolate ROI vertices or displayed
%                lines between vertices
%
% Interpolate Across Time
%  For data with high temporal resolution or through-plane spatial resolution, 
%  it may be helpful to only trace ROIs on certain frames (e.g. every other 
%  frame) and linearly interpolate the ROIs on the remaining frames.  To do
%  this, trace on the desired frames, and press 'a' to interpolate the ROIs
%  to all other frames between the first and last frame with drawn ROIs.  It is
%  important to note that each vertex is linearly interpolated independently, so
%  ROIs of the same index number must have the same number of vertices in the
%  traced frames.  Additionally, each vertex should correspond to roughly the
%  same structure of interest in each traced frame.
%
% ROI Toggles
%  The display of ROIs can be toggled using the 't' key in order to facilitate
%  fine countour adjustments.  The 'y' key can be used to temporarily apply the
%  ROIs as a mask to visualize the pixels enclosed by each ROI.  If there are
%  2-4 ROIs, these are assumed to be short axis myocardial contours, i.e.
%  epicardium, endocardium, RV insertion point, and blood pool.
%
% ROI Raw Data Tables
%  The means and standard deviations within each ROI are displayed in tabular
%  format in the correspondingly named tabs of the ROI figure.  Values can be
%  copied from this table.
%
% ROI "M-mode"
%  For line segment ROIs (i.e. ROIs that are finished with a shift right-click)
%  where the image data has a time dimension, an "M-mode" like image is
%  shown in the "M-mode" tab of the ROI figure.  This image shows the signal
%  intensity profile along the line segment in the vertical dimension (top is
%  the beginning of the line segment) and along time in the horizontal dimension
%  (time increasing to the right).
%
% Saving Workspaces
%  SimpleViewer workspaces can be saved using the 's' key.  This saves all
%  variables necessary to restore a SimpleViewer session to a .svmat/.mat file.
%  Saved workspaces can be loaded by passing the .svmat/.mat file name when
%  calling SimpleViewer.  An .svmat file is identical in format to a standard
%  MATLAB .mat file, but may be automatically opened by SimpleViewer if an
%  appropriately defined opensvmat.m function is defined. e.g.:
%    function opensvmat(filename)
%      figure;
%      SimpleViewer(filename);
%    end
%
%  Note that similar functions can also be created for SimpleViewer supported
%  graphics and movie formats to enable drag-and-drop functionality, e.g.
%  opengif, openavi, etc functions.
%
% Export Image/movie
%  A SimpleViewer figure can be exported as a GIF, JPEG, or PNG image using the
%  'e' key.  A movie (in the time dimension) can be exported in animated GIF
%  format, AVI format ("Motion JPEG Video"), or mp4 format ("MPEG-4 Video").
%  Note that exporting avi/mp4 files from MATLAB versions prior to R2014b may
%  have dropped frames when encoded at ~30+ fps due to poor performance of the
%  VideoWriter internal function
%
% Plot Figure
%  If the preference 'suppressRoiPlot' is set to false, a new window is created
%  when an ROI is drawn. This window shows a plot of the signal intensity within
%  the ROI over the time dimension. If the preference 'showStdPlot' is set to
%  true, error bars are plotted at +/- one standard deviation and can be hidden
%  with the 'h' command. Alternatively, if a line segment ROI is drawn (i.e. an
%  ROI completed with a shift-click), a spatial profile along the line is drawn.
%  In both cases, the ROI may be adjusted and the plot will be updated in
%  real-time. Note that SimpleViewer does not properly support temporal and
%  spatial profiles simultaneously.
%
%  The mean and standard deviation of pixels within each ROI are displayed each
%  time frame in tabular format in the secondary plot figure.  Values can be
%  selected and copied to other spreadsheet programs.
%
% Home Times
%  The 'home times' is set using prefs.homeTime (default: 1).  Pressing spacebar
%  changes the displayed image to the home time.  If prefs.homeTime is an array,
%  pressing spacebar once changes to the first home time, again for the second
%  home time, etc.
%
% Preferences Editor
%  If the 'propertiesGUI' function is found in the path (available through the
%  MATLAB File Exchange), the F12 key can be used to edit the prefs struct for
%  an active SimpleViewer workspace
%
% ----- For SimpleViewer programmers -------------------------------------------
% ROI Transcription
%  By default, ROIs drawn on each subplot are independent.  In some cases, such
%  as with co-registered images or data with corresponding parametric maps, it
%  may be useful to draw on multiple subplots simultaneously.  This can be
%  controlled via the prefs.transcribeRoi with the following settings:
%   - false:       No transcribing (default)
%   - true:        Transcribe to all plots
%   - cell array:  Each cell is an array containing subplot indices.  Subplots
%                  in each array are linked and ROIs are copied between them
%  Transcribing between subplots can be toggled with the 'l' key if
%  prefs.transcribeRoi is not a cell array.
%
% ROI Colours
%  The order of ROI colours is controlled via prefs.roiColors, which may either
%  be a character array of pre-defined MATLAB colours (e.g. 'rgb' for red,
%  green, and blue ROIs), or an (n x 3) array of RGB colours (i.e. the format
%  for colourmaps).  ROI colours are cyclic, so the colours repeat when the
%  number of ROIs exceeds the number of defined colours.
%
% Black and White ROIs
%  ROIs may shown as black lines with white vertices, which may be useful when
%  tracing on coloured images.  This is controlled via prefs.blackWhiteRoi with
%  the following settings:
%   - false:  Coloured ROIs according to prefs.roiColors (default)
%   - true:   All ROIs are black and white
%   - array:  Entries are subplot indices where black and white ROIs are used
% 
% Interactive Usage
%  The 'enter' key is intentionally left unbound.  To use SimpleViewer
%  interactively to get drawn ROIs, window level, etc, use the following code:
%
%    waitfor(hFig, 'CurrentCharacter', char(13));  % char(13) is "enter"
%    set(hFig, 'currentch', char(1));  % reset 'CurrentCharacter'
%    % Code to run after user input
%
%  The second line may be omitted, but waitfor() will immediately return if
%  called again later in the code on the same figure.
%
% Custom Keyboard Callbacks
%  SimpleViewer functionality may be extended through the use of custom
%  functions (callbacks) that are called when keys are pressed.  These are
%  defined via prefs.kbCallbacks, which is a struct in which each field name is
%  a key and each field value is a function handle.  This function must take
%  the SimpleViewer figure handle as its only argument.  Note that default
%  keyboard callbacks may be disabled by using an empty field value.
%
% Programmatic SimpleViewer Control 
%  Many internal SimpleViewer functions are exposed via prefs.fcnHandles, which
%  is a struct where each field name is the SimpleViewer function name and the
%  field value is the function handle.  This can be used to control SimpleViewer
%  from within scripts (e.g. change time/slice, enter/exit modes, etc).
%
% Contrast Adjustment Modifiers
%  Contrast (window/level) adjustments on one subplot are automatically applied
%  to all other subplots unless the alt key is held.  This may not be desirable
%  if there the displayed images have very different contrasts and may be
%  controlled with prefs.linkWindowLevel with:
%   - true:       Contrast is adjusted for all subplots simultaneously (default)
%   - false:      Each subplot is contrast adjusted independently
%   - cell array: Each cell is an array containing subplot indices.  Subplots
%                 in each array have contrast adjustments linked
%  Some data have meaningful values, such as the zero point for
%  positive/negative data.  It may be desirable to adjust the contrast window
%  without adjusting level, such that the zero point maintains the same colour.
%  This can be enabled by setting prefs.disableLevelAdjust to true.
%
% Simplified 'img' Formats
%  In order make SimpleViewer more accessible for quick usage, 'img' supports
%  a 5D matrix or a simple 1D cell array instead of the "nested cell" format.
%  Additionally, if prefs.autoSlicesToCine is true, img data which has multiple
%  slices but only a single time is convered to img data with a single slice and
%  multiple times.  Any other arguments (CLim, roi, txt, ...) are optional or
%  can be provided as empty matrices ([]) if necessary.
%
% 'Extra' Data
%  It may sometimes be useful to store additional data in a SimpleViewer figure,
%  such as metadata for the images or data used by custom callback functions.
%  The 'extras' field with setappdata(hFig, ...) is saved when saving workspaces
%  and is restored when loading workspaces.
%
% Notes:
%  - Subplots are ordered left-to-right in the top row, then left-to-right in
%    the next row down, etc., as with the subplot(m,n,p) syntax.  'hAxes' (used
%    internally), is a 2D matrix with rows and columns REVERSED of the subplot
%    layout, such that linear indexing into 'hAxes' works as expected.
%  - SimpleViewer recycles the current figure, much like image() and imagesc().
%  - SimpleViewer uses the OpenGL renderer for speed. When saving in eps format,
%    use "set(gcf, 'Renderer', 'painters')" so that ROI objects are editable.
%    Note also that 'h' will set this mode.
%
% Tips:
%  - A nested cell array m{i}{j} can be converted into a 2d cell array n{i,j}:
%      n = cat(1, m{:});
%    This assumes that all m{i} have the same number of elements 'j' and that
%    m{i} is a single-row cell array.
%  - A SimpleViewer window and its ROI data plot window are programmed to close
%    each other if one closes.  If a window is closed by some other means (e.g.
%    if "close all" is used), then the other window won't close properly.  In
%    that case, use select the figure and use the command:
%        delete(gcf)
%    Alternatively, delete all open figures using the command:
%        delete(get(0,'Children'))
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Bug tracker:
% - UpdateRoiFigure() should actually not draw deleted ROI data instead of just
%   having a line plot with no data
% - The profile and m-mode tabs on the ROI plot figure cannot be exported in
%   <R2014b.
%  - No range checking for transcribeRois could lead to crashes

%            to the current subplot if 'alt' is held
%  4.2.2   - New: If DICOM headers are stored in the extras field (e.g. through

%            different subplots can be displayed with 'x'
%            New: If DICOM headers are available, they can be displayed using
%            ctrl+i
