% This is KLT Filter function, there are two inputs: the 3-D data
% array and the percentage eign images you want to keep [a_r,V_0,D] = KLT_Filter3D(a,r), a is
% a 3-D array, the third dimension is the frame number, r is a number
% smaller than 1.0, that is the ratio of the eign images you want to keep.
% This version has the FAST algorithm: Don't calculate the Eigen Images.
